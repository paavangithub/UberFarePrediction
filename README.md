# UberFarePrediction
In this project, we have built a machine learning model to predict the fare amount for a ride on Uber. We have preprocessed the data, performed feature engineering, trained and evaluated various machine learning models, and deployed our model to a production environment. Our model can be used to provide accurate fare predictions to riders and drivers and can help improve the overall user experience on Uber.
